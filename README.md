# citypop

To run the app, the command line tool Expo CLI has to be installed. It can be installed using `$ npm install --global expo-cli`.<br>
If it is the first time running the app, you also have to run `$ npm install`.
Once Expo CLI is installed, serve the app via `$ expo start` in the root directory. This command opens a webpage with a QR code. This code has to be scanned with the Expo Go app your phone to launch the CityPop app. If an iPhone is used, the code can be scanned with the camera app but Expo Go still has to be installed.
